### Essay - January 25, 2019

During this winter break, I had the idea of completing the easy problems in the training section of a well-known
algorithm training platform called Luogu (洛谷). I specifically focused on the practice problems in or below the"
Senior" (提高) level. Afterward, my plan was to delve into the Kuangbin's Algorithm Lesson (kuangbin带你飞) to further
improve my coding skills. Considering the time it would take, I anticipated finishing by May. My ultimate goal is to win
a gold medal in the provincial competition this time.

I'd better not study advanced data structures like those in the "Senior+" (提高+) level. Just mastering dynamic
programming, mathematics, and computational geometry is already enough to keep me busy.
